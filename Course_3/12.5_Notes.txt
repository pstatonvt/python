[Parsing Web Pages]

Web Scraping - when a program pretends to be a browser and retrieves web pages, looks at those web pages, extracts information, and then looks at more web pages... "spidering the web" or "web crawling"

Why Scrape?
Pull or extract data, but be careful! Make sure it's legal for the site you're scraping!

Beautiful Soup
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

---
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
from bs4 import BeatifulSoup

url = input('Enter - ')
html = urllib.request.uropen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

# Retrieve all of the anchor tags
tags = soup('a')
for tag in tags:
	print(tag.get('href', None))

[new name in dictionary]

counts = dict()
for name in names:
  if name not in counts:
    counts[name]=1
  else:
    counts[name] += 1

-----

[get method]

x = [dict].get([key],[default]) .. so for example... x = counts.get(name, 0)
#so NEW keys get a default value of zero + 1 (SO.. 1)
counts = dict()
names = ['csev','cwen','csev','zqian','cwen']
for name in names:
  counts[name] = counts.get(name, 0) + 1
print(counts)

[looping through dictionaries]
for [tag] in [dict]:
  print(key, counts[key])
  

"[dict].items()" includes both KEYS and VALUES

[iterating through a dictionary]
